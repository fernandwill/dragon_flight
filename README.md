# 🐉 Dragon Flight

**Dragon Flight** is a simple, lightweight JavaScript arcade game where you guide a dragon through endless obstacles. The goal? Stay alive as long as possible while scoring points by dodging pillars. Think *Flappy Bird*, but with a dragon and full keyboard control!

## 🎮 Features

- 🐲 Play as a dragon flying through a vibrant sky
- 🪨 Avoid procedurally generated top & bottom obstacles
- ⌨️ Controls via arrow keys or WASD
- 💯 Dynamic score tracking with difficulty scaling
- 💀 Game over screen with replay functionality
- 🌤️ Animated background with moving clouds and smooth visuals

## 🧠 How It Works

- **HTML/CSS** creates a responsive, glassy UI with a canvas in the center.
- **JavaScript** handles rendering, user input, obstacle generation, collision detection, and game loop logic.
- As your score increases, the game speeds up, adding challenge over time.

## 🚀 Controls

Use your keyboard to fly:
- `↑` or `W`: Move up  
- `↓` or `S`: Move down  
- `←` or `A`: Move left  
- `→` or `D`: Move right
